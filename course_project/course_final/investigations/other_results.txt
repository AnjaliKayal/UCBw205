In philadelphia there are approximately 48,396 jobs and the average salary is $57,366.

By comparison in boston there are approximately 96,792 jobs and the average salary is $68,873.

Finally in NYC there are approximately 48,000 jobs and the salareis are around $68,000.

Since boston has more jobs and a higher salary even which the smaller population, boston wins economic, the philly (becase it has the same amount of jobs and even though the salary is lower, the cost of living in pilly is siginificantly lower than in NYC. So the lower income is still more value. Finally I would put NYC last as it is a bustling city at all times.
