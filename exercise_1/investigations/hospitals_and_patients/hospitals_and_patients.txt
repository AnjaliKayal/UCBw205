There is a small correlation between the survey results by hospital and hospital scores.  The correlation is 0.179, which shows a small correlation between surveys and hospital scores. This correlation measure is valid because the survey scores and hospital scores are done on different ranges; and thus the best way to compare them and their relation is with by finding the correlational coeffficient.  This shows that while there is some correlation between the scores it is small and that the hospital scores are likely impacted by something else significantly more.  

In order to assess procedural variability and it's correlation to patient survey responses we need to think about this carefully.  Survey responses are not based on procedures and thus we cannot compare procedureal survey scores to procedural data across different hospitals.  However we can look at the variance of hospital scores within a hospital (i.e. hospital variance scores) and compare that to the variance amongst survey responses for a specific hospital to understand the variability within a hospital of different procedures.  Here this is done with a select statement that finds the correlational coefficient between the two different variances in the hospital_survey_compares tables.  The result here is a correlational coefficient under .001 - which implies a lack of correlation.
