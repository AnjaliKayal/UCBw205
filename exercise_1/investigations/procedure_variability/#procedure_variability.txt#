This is an appropriate measure becasue we organize the variability on the range and also consider the variance across these different measures.  We choose to rank the procedures by range because even though the variance can be smaller if the scores are sufficiently high than there can be a huge range - variability - but the variance will be smaller. As a result looking at range is sufficient to determine variability across hospitals.
